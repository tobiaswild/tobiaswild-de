# Contribution "instructions"

## Getting the up-to-date source

`git clone https://github.com/tobiaswild/tobiaswild.de.git`

-   master branch has the currently released stuff and is stable

## Making changes

-   Make your changes against the master branch

-   If you have fixed a bug or modified the source code in some other acceptable way,
    I most likely want to receive the changes as a GitHub pull request
